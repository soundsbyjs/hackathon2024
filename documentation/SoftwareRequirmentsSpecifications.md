# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for SafeRideVerify

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the software requirements for SafeRideVerify, a peer-to-peer authentication application designed to enhance safety in ridesharing apps. It specifies the functional and non-functional requirements, system features, and constraints of the application.

### 1.2 Scope
SafeRideVerify aims to provide a secure authentication platform for ridesharing apps, ensuring the safety of both drivers and passengers through a multi-factor authentication process before, during, and after each ride.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
SafeRideVerify is a standalone application that integrates with existing ridesharing platforms to provide an added layer of security through user authentication.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Pre-Ride Authentication: Verifies the identity of both the driver and the passenger before the ride begins.
- Post-Ride Check-In: Ensures the continued safety of the passenger after the ride has concluded.
- User Management: Allows users to create and manage their accounts, including setting up authentication methods.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- Ridesharing Passengers: Individuals seeking a safe and secure transportation option.
- Ridesharing Drivers: Drivers who want to ensure their safety and the safety of their passengers.
- Ridesharing Platforms: Companies that wish to enhance the security features of their applications.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
SafeRideVerify will be deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and will use Cloud SQL for database management. The application will be developed in Python.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Pre-Ride Authentication
#### 3.1.1 Description
The system shall authenticate the identities of both the driver and the passenger before the ride begins using a multi-factor authentication process.
#### 3.1.2 Functional Requirements
- FR1: The system shall generate a unique authentication code for each ride.
- FR2: The system shall require both the driver and the passenger to enter the authentication code before starting the ride.

### 3.2 Post-Ride Check-In
#### 3.2.1 Description
The system shall provide an optional post-ride check-in feature to ensure the continued safety of the passenger.
#### 3.2.2 Functional Requirements
- FR3: The system shall send a check-in notification to the passenger within a predefined time frame after the ride has concluded.
- FR4: The system shall allow the passenger to confirm their safety through the application.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces
- The application shall provide a user-friendly interface for account creation, authentication setup, and ride verification.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
